# Choleski.identification-and-Long.Run.identification
Choleski identification for monetary policy shocks and Long-run identification. This project was prepared for a group homework assignment by me and my groupmates for the class of '20532: Macroeconometrics'.

## Features
In ex1 we use log(real GDP), log(Price deflator) and Federal Funds Rate for the US from 1960 to 2010 at quarterly frequency to estimate a VAR on these variables, identify the monetary policy shock with a triangular identification structure with the ordering above, and then compute impulse responses and variance decompositions for the monetary policy shock. Additionaly we also compute confidence intervals around the point estimates for the impulse responses using a bootstrap.

In ex2 we replicate Figure 2 from the paper of "Technology, employment, and the business cycle: do technology shocks explain aggregate fluctuations?" Gali (1999) and compute bootstrapped confidence bands.

## Technical Properties
Written in MATLAB R2024b.
